somebody requested a quick python tool to decipher text so here it is
just an implementation of the encryption used by Bajerino, but in python

# features
- decryption
    - can decrypt messages sent by bajerino or generated by `encrypt.py`
    - enter encryption password via CLI: `--encryption_password <password>`
    - output either to terminal or to file via `-o <file.ext>` or `--output <file.ext>`
    - single line of just cipher text
        - exit by typing exit or pressing `ctrl+c`
    - multiline input in Justlog/Rustlog Format
        - from terminal
        - from file
        - from url
- encryption
    - just generates encrypted text in the format as Bajerino, decryptable by Bajerino or `decrypt.py`
    - enter encryption password via CLI: `--encryption_password <password>`

# requirements
- python3
- uv (optional, but recommended, can automatically install python for you as well)

# setup
## easy setup on computers
1. install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)
1. open terminal in this directory and enter either `uv run decrypt.py` or `uv run encrypt.py`

## manual setup
1. open terminal in this directory
    - on Windows be sure to use Powershell
1. run the following:
    - if on windows: `py -m venv .venv`
    - macos or linux: `python3 -m venv .venv`
1. then the following
    - windows: `.\.venv\bin\Activate.ps1`
    - macos or linux(assuming sh type shell): `. .venv/bin/activate`
1. now `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. now you can run the program `python3 decipher.py`
